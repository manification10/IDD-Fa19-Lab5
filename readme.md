# Jack in the Box

## Design

Please put your sketches or designs for the Jack in the Box.

I used laser cutting for box side design. And an open source stl file for a halloween ghost that I 3D printed for jack. 
My box is October themed. October for me is Halloween (my ghost jack) and Durga Puja (laser cut on the box).
